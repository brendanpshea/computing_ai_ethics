% SLIDE 2: What Is Intellectual Property?
%------------------------------------------------------
\begin{frame}{What Is Intellectual Property?}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Intellectual property (IP)} refers to legal rights granted over creations of the mind, including inventions, artistic works, designs, and brand names.
        \item Unlike physical property such as land or cars, intellectual property is \textbf{non-rivalrous}---my using an idea doesn't prevent you from using the same idea simultaneously.
        \item IP law creates artificial scarcity by granting creators temporary exclusive rights, allowing them to control who uses their creations and to profit from that control.
        \item The major forms of IP include \textbf{patents} (inventions), \textbf{copyrights} (creative works), \textbf{trademarks} (brand identifiers), and \textbf{trade secrets} (confidential business information).
    \end{itemize}
    
    \vspace{0.3em}
    
    \begin{block}{Physical vs. Intellectual Property}
        If I take your bicycle, you no longer have it. But if I copy your song, you still have it too---we both do. This fundamental difference makes IP philosophically puzzling: why grant exclusive rights over something that can be infinitely shared?

% SLIDE 3: Why Does Intellectual Property Matter?
%------------------------------------------------------
\begin{frame}{Why Does Intellectual Property Matter?}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item IP-intensive industries---including software, pharmaceuticals, entertainment, and manufacturing---account for trillions of dollars in economic activity and millions of jobs worldwide.
        \item Intellectual property shapes everyday life: the music you stream, the medicines you take, the apps on your phone, and the brands you recognize are all governed by IP law.
        \item IP rules determine what you can legally create, share, remix, and repair---affecting everything from posting memes to fixing your own tractor.
        \item Debates over IP have intensified in the digital age, as copying and sharing have become nearly costless while enforcement has become increasingly difficult.

% SLIDE 4: The Central Tension
%------------------------------------------------------
\begin{frame}{The Central Tension}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Creators} want recognition, control, and financial reward for their work---without protection, others could simply copy and profit from their efforts.
        \item \textbf{Society} benefits when ideas spread freely, allowing others to build on existing knowledge, create new works, and access information without barriers.
        \item Every intellectual property system must balance these competing interests, and different societies at different times have struck very different balances.
        \item Finding the right balance is genuinely difficult: too little protection may discourage creation, while too much protection may lock away knowledge and stifle innovation.

% SLIDE 5: A Brief History of Intellectual Property
%------------------------------------------------------
\begin{frame}{A Brief History of Intellectual Property}
    \begin{itemize}
        \small
        \item The first known patent law was enacted in \textbf{Venice in 1474}, granting glassblowers exclusive rights to their techniques for ten years to encourage innovation and prevent trade secrets from leaving the city.
        \item The \textbf{Statute of Anne} (England, 1710) was the first modern copyright law, granting authors---not publishers---rights to their works for a limited 14-year term.
        \item The U.S. Constitution (1787) explicitly empowers Congress to grant IP rights ``to promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts''---notably framing IP as a \textit{means} to public benefit, not an end in itself.
        \item IP protections have expanded dramatically over time: copyright terms have grown from 14 years to life plus 70 years, and patent coverage has extended to software, business methods, and genes.
    \end{itemize}

% SLIDE 6: Utilitarian Justifications for IP
%------------------------------------------------------
\begin{frame}{Utilitarian Justifications for IP}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The \textbf{utilitarian} approach, associated with philosophers like Bentham and Mill, holds that IP is justified only if it produces the greatest good for the greatest number.
        \item The core argument: without legal protection, creators cannot profit from their work because competitors will simply copy it, so fewer people will invest time and resources in creating new things.
        \item IP creates a \textbf{temporary monopoly} as an incentive---the creator gets exclusive rights for a limited time, after which the work enters the public domain for everyone to use.
        \item On this view, IP is a necessary evil: monopolies are generally bad, but the innovation they encourage outweighs the costs of restricted access.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \vspace{0.3em}
    
    \begin{quote}
        \footnotesize
        ``Considering the exclusive right to invention as given not of natural right, but for the benefit of society, I know well the difficulty of drawing a line between the things which are worth to the public the embarrassment of an exclusive patent, and those which are not.'' \\ \hfill ---Thomas Jefferson
    \end{quote}
\end{frame}

%------------------------------------------------------
% SLIDE 7: Utilitarian Trade-offs: Incentives vs. Access
%------------------------------------------------------
\begin{frame}{Utilitarian Trade-offs: Incentives vs. Access}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Too little protection}: Creators can't recoup investments, leading to less innovation---why spend years developing a drug if competitors can copy it immediately?
        \item \textbf{Too much protection}: Ideas get locked away, others can't build on them, and consumers pay monopoly prices---innovation is stifled by the very system meant to encourage it.
        \item The utilitarian question is empirical: \textit{What level of protection actually maximizes overall social benefit?} This requires evidence, not just intuition.
    \end{itemize}

% SLIDE 8: Lockean Justifications for IP
%------------------------------------------------------
\begin{frame}{Lockean Justifications for IP}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Philosopher John Locke argued that property rights arise when you \textbf{mix your labor} with something unowned---by working the land, you make it yours.
        \item Applied to intellectual property: when you invest mental effort to create something new---a novel, an invention, a song---the product of that labor rightfully belongs to you.
        \item Unlike the utilitarian view, this is a \textbf{natural rights} argument: you deserve the fruits of your labor regardless of whether IP laws maximize social welfare.
        \item The Lockean view explains why IP infringement feels like \textit{theft}---someone is taking what you created through your own effort.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \vspace{0.3em}
    
    \begin{exampleblock}{Locke on Labor and Property}
        ``Whatsoever then he removes out of the state that nature hath provided, and left it in, he hath mixed his labour with, and joined to it something that is his own, and thereby makes it his property.'' \\ \hfill ---John Locke, \textit{Second Treatise of Government} (1689)
    \end{exampleblock}
\end{frame}

%------------------------------------------------------
% SLIDE 9: Challenges to Lockean IP Theory
%------------------------------------------------------
\begin{frame}{Challenges to Lockean IP Theory}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Ideas always build on previous ideas---Newton famously said he saw further by ``standing on the shoulders of giants''---so can anyone claim their creation is purely their own labor?
        \item Unlike physical property, ideas are not naturally scarce: if I ``take'' your idea, you still have it, so the usual justification for property rights (preventing deprivation) doesn't obviously apply.
        \item Locke's theory included a crucial \textbf{proviso}: you can only claim property if you leave ``enough and as good'' for others to use---but strong IP rights may violate this by restricting everyone else's access.
        \item The Lockean view also struggles to explain why IP should ever expire: if you earned it through labor, why should it enter the public domain after a set number of years?
    \end{itemize}
    
    \vspace{0.3em}
    
    \begin{alertblock}{The Lockean Proviso Problem}
        When you fence off land, others can still use different land. But when you patent an invention or copyright an expression, you restrict \textit{everyone} from using that specific idea---potentially leaving nothing ``enough and as good'' for others.
    \end{alertblock}
\end{frame}

%------------------------------------------------------
% SLIDE 10: Arguments Against Strong IP
%------------------------------------------------------
\begin{frame}{Arguments Against Strong IP}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The slogan ``information wants to be free'' (Stewart Brand, 1984) captures the idea that IP creates \textbf{artificial scarcity} where none naturally exists---ideas can be copied infinitely at near-zero cost.
        \item Critics argue that strong IP concentrates power in large corporations rather than individual creators, since companies can afford lawyers and lobbying while artists often sign away their rights.
        \item Historical evidence is mixed: many scientific breakthroughs (from calculus to the polio vaccine) occurred without IP incentives, suggesting innovation doesn't require strong protection.
        \item Some economists argue IP actually \textit{reduces} innovation by preventing others from building on existing ideas and by encouraging secrecy over sharing.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \vspace{0.3em}
    
    \begin{exampleblock}{Jonas Salk and the Polio Vaccine}
        When asked who owned the patent on his polio vaccine, Jonas Salk replied: ``The people. Could you patent the sun?'' He deliberately chose not to patent it, allowing free global distribution that saved millions of lives.
    \end{exampleblock}
\end{frame}

%------------------------------------------------------
% SLIDE 11: Finding Balance: The IP Spectrum
%------------------------------------------------------
\begin{frame}{Finding Balance: The IP Spectrum}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item IP policy exists on a spectrum from no protection at all (everything in the public domain) to maximal protection (perpetual, absolute rights over every creation).
        \item Different societies have chosen different points on this spectrum, and the same society may choose different levels for different types of IP (stronger for pharmaceuticals, weaker for fashion).
        \item Over the past century, IP terms have consistently expanded: U.S. copyright went from 14 years (1790) to 28 years (1909) to life plus 50 years (1976) to life plus 70 years (1998).
        \item Critics call this ``term creep'' and note that each extension came just before Mickey Mouse would have entered the public domain---earning the 1998 law the nickname ``Mickey Mouse Protection Act.''

        \item If you write a song, do you ``own'' the melody the way you own your bicycle? What's similar about these two types of ownership, and what's fundamentally different?
        
        \vspace{0.5em}
        
        \item The utilitarian view says IP is justified if it maximizes innovation. What kind of evidence would show that current IP terms are too long---or too short?
        
        \vspace{0.5em}
        
        \item The Lockean view says you own what you create through your labor. But if all ideas build on previous ideas, can anyone truly claim original ownership of their creations?
        
        \vspace{0.5em}
        
        \item Jonas Salk gave away the polio vaccine freely. Should more inventors follow his example? What would happen to pharmaceutical research if no one could patent medicines?

% SLIDE 13: Patents: Protecting Inventions
%------------------------------------------------------
\begin{frame}{Patents: Protecting Inventions}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A \textbf{patent} grants the inventor exclusive rights to make, use, and sell an invention for a limited time---typically 20 years from the filing date in most countries.
        \item To receive a patent, an invention must meet three requirements: it must be \textbf{novel} (new), \textbf{non-obvious} (not an evident next step), and \textbf{useful} (it actually works).
        \item In exchange for this temporary monopoly, the inventor must \textbf{publicly disclose} how the invention works, adding to humanity's collective knowledge.
        \item After the patent expires, anyone can freely use the invention---this is how generic drugs become available after brand-name patents end.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \vspace{0.3em}
    
    \begin{block}{The Three Requirements for Patentability}
        \textbf{Novel}: No one has done this exact thing before. \textbf{Non-obvious}: A skilled person in the field wouldn't consider it an obvious next step. \textbf{Useful}: It actually accomplishes something practical.

% SLIDE 14: Case Study: Pharmaceutical Patents and Public Health
%------------------------------------------------------
\begin{frame}{Case Study: Pharmaceutical Patents and Public Health}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Developing a new drug costs an estimated \$1--2 billion and takes 10--15 years, so pharmaceutical companies argue patents are essential to recoup these massive investments.
        \item However, patent-protected drugs can cost 10--100 times more than generics, putting life-saving treatments out of reach for patients in poorer countries.
        \item The HIV/AIDS crisis made this tension visible: patented antiretroviral drugs cost \$10,000+/year while generic versions cost under \$100, leading to millions of preventable deaths.
        \item COVID-19 renewed the debate: should vaccine patents be waived during global health emergencies to allow faster, cheaper worldwide production?

%------------------------------------------------------
\begin{frame}{Trade Secrets: The Coca-Cola Approach}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A \textbf{trade secret} is confidential business information that provides competitive advantage---formulas, processes, customer lists, or strategies that companies keep hidden.
        \item Unlike patents, trade secrets require no registration and can last \textit{forever}---as long as the information remains secret.
        \item The law protects trade secrets against theft, espionage, and breach of confidentiality agreements, but offers no protection if someone independently discovers or reverse-engineers the secret.
        \item The risk is total loss: once a trade secret becomes public (through leaks, hacking, or carelessness), protection is gone permanently with no way to restore it.
    \end{itemize}

    \begin{exampleblock}{Coca-Cola's Famous Formula}
        Coca-Cola has kept its formula secret since 1886---over 135 years. The company chose secrecy over patents because a patent would have expired decades ago and revealed the recipe to everyone.

        \item Copyright is \textbf{automatic}: the moment you create something original and fix it in tangible form (write it down, record it), you have copyright---no registration required.
        \item Crucially, copyright protects \textbf{expression, not ideas}: anyone can write a story about a boy wizard at magic school, but they can't copy J.K. Rowling's specific words and characters.
        \item Current U.S. copyright lasts for the author's life plus 70 years---meaning works created today won't enter the public domain until the 22nd century.

%------------------------------------------------------
\begin{frame}{Fair Use: When Copying Is Allowed}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Fair use} is a legal doctrine that allows limited use of copyrighted material without permission for purposes like criticism, commentary, news reporting, teaching, and research.
        \item Courts evaluate fair use by weighing four factors: the purpose of the use, the nature of the original work, how much was taken, and the effect on the market for the original.
        \item Fair use is deliberately flexible---there are no bright-line rules, which means each case depends on its specific facts and requires judgment.
        \item This flexibility protects free expression but creates uncertainty: you often can't know for sure whether something is fair use until a court decides.

\begin{frame}{Fair Use in Practice}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Parody} is generally protected: ``Weird Al'' Yankovic's song parodies mock the originals, transforming them into comedy (though he asks permission anyway out of courtesy).
        \item \textbf{Commentary and criticism} often qualify: video essayists can use film clips to analyze and critique movies because the clips serve a new purpose.
        \item \textbf{Transformative use} is key: appropriation artists like Andy Warhol took existing images but transformed their meaning---courts increasingly favor uses that add new expression or meaning.
        \item \textbf{Educational use} has some protection, but it's not absolute: showing a film in class may be fair use, but photocopying an entire textbook for students is not.
    \end{itemize}

    \begin{exampleblock}{Campbell v. Acuff-Rose (1994)}
        2 Live Crew's rap parody of Roy Orbison's ``Pretty Woman'' was ruled fair use by the Supreme Court, even though it was commercial and used the song's distinctive opening riff. The Court held that parody is transformative because it comments on the original work.

        \item A \textbf{trademark} is a word, symbol, design, or combination that identifies the source of goods or services---the Nike swoosh, McDonald's golden arches, or Apple's apple.
        \item Trademarks protect consumers from confusion (ensuring you get authentic products) and protect businesses' investment in their reputation and brand identity.
        \item Unlike patents and copyrights, trademarks can last \textit{forever}---as long as the owner continues using and actively defending the mark.
        \item Companies must aggressively protect trademarks or risk \textbf{genericide}: when a brand name becomes so common it loses protection (aspirin, escalator, thermos, zipper were all once trademarks).

    \begin{alertblock}{Why Companies Seem Trademark-Obsessed}
        When Google asks you to say ``search the web'' instead of ``google it,'' they're not being petty---they're trying to prevent ``google'' from becoming generic like ``xerox'' or ``kleenex.'' Losing trademark status means losing exclusive rights to your own brand name.

        \item Apple sued Samsung for copying the iPhone's design, including its rounded rectangular shape, grid of icons, and slide-to-unlock feature, winning over \$1 billion in damages (later reduced).
        \item Critics argued these patents covered obvious design choices that no one should own: rectangles with rounded corners have existed for centuries, and grid layouts are a natural way to organize apps.

        \item In \textit{Bridgeport Music v. Dimension Films} (2005), the court ruled that even a two-second, unrecognizable sample requires a license, declaring ``get a license or do not sample.''
        \item The ``Blurred Lines'' case (2015) went further: Robin Thicke and Pharrell Williams were ordered to pay \$5 million to Marvin Gaye's estate because their song captured the ``feel'' of Gaye's ``Got to Give It Up''---even without copying specific notes.
        \item Musicians and legal scholars warned this could chill creativity by making artists liable for songs that merely sound similar to older works.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Patent trolls} (or ``non-practicing entities'') are companies that acquire patents not to make products but solely to sue or threaten others for infringement.
        \item Their business model exploits the fact that patent litigation costs millions to defend, so many companies pay settlements even for dubious claims rather than fight in court.
        \item Small businesses and startups are particularly vulnerable: a troll's demand letter can threaten their survival, forcing them to pay ``licensing fees'' for patents they may not even infringe.
        \item Studies estimate patent trolls cost the U.S. economy \$29 billion annually in direct costs, plus immeasurable innovation lost when startups shut down or avoid certain technologies.
    \end{itemize}

        \item The law has two major components: \textbf{safe harbor} provisions that protect platforms from liability for user uploads, and \textbf{anti-circumvention} rules that make it illegal to bypass digital locks.
        \item Originally focused on music and movie piracy, the DMCA now affects nearly every digital technology---from YouTube videos to smart tractors to medical devices.

        \item The twist: breaking these locks is illegal \textit{even if your intended use would be perfectly legal}, such as making a backup copy, exercising fair use rights, or accessing content you purchased.
        \item This means you can legally own a DVD but face federal penalties for bypassing its copy protection to watch it on your laptop without a DVD drive.

\begin{frame}{The Philosophy: ``Free as in Freedom''}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Programmer and activist \textbf{Richard Stallman} argues that software freedom is an ethical issue: proprietary software that hides its code treats users as prisoners rather than participants.
        \item Stallman distinguishes ``free software'' from ``freeware'': the point isn't zero cost but \textbf{liberty}---``free as in freedom, not free as in beer.''
        \item On this view, sharing software is a social good, and restrictions on sharing are antisocial---just as it would be wrong to forbid lending books to friends.
        \item Stallman's Free Software Foundation promotes software that respects user freedom and opposes DRM, software patents, and proprietary formats that lock users in.

        \item \textbf{Linus Torvalds} created Linux (1991), the kernel that combined with GNU tools to form a complete operating system; he takes a pragmatic rather than ideological approach.
        \item \textbf{Eric Raymond} wrote ``The Cathedral and the Bazaar'' (1997), arguing that open source produces better software through decentralized collaboration---``given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow.''
        \item The movement split between ``free software'' (Stallman's ethical focus) and ``open source'' (Raymond's practical focus), though the licenses and code overlap significantly.

        \item \textbf{Open AI models} release weights publicly, allowing anyone to download, run locally, modify, and build upon them---examples include Meta's LLaMA, France's Mistral, and China's Qwen and DeepSeek.
        \item Many leading open models are now \textbf{Chinese-developed}, which raises distinct concerns: built-in censorship of politically sensitive topics, potential alignment with Chinese government interests, and uncertainty about training data sources.
        \item Ironically, \textbf{OpenAI}---founded in 2015 to develop AI ``for the benefit of all humanity''---has become increasingly closed, citing safety and competitive concerns as Chinese alternatives proliferate.

        \item The central tension remains: \textbf{creators deserve recognition and reward} for their work, but \textbf{society benefits when knowledge flows freely}---every IP system must balance these values.
        \item New questions keep emerging: Who owns AI-generated content? Should you be able to repair your own tractor? Is training on copyrighted data fair use? How do we preserve digital culture?
        \item There are no perfect answers---IP involves genuine tradeoffs between competing goods, and different societies will continue to strike different balances.
