## Course Description 📖

In a world increasingly reliant on technology, the ethical implications of computing and artificial intelligence (AI) are more relevant than ever. This course seeks to bridge the gap between technology and ethical inquiry, providing students with the tools to critically evaluate and address ethical dilemmas in various domains of computing, AI, and data science. The course covers a wide range of topics, from fundamental ethical theories to futuristic considerations in AI ethics. Topics include the history of computing, AI and machine learning basics, data privacy, algorithmic bias and fairness, surveillance, security, employment in the age of AI, bioethics in computing, ethics in video games and virtual reality, AI ethics in science fiction, and future policy and design considerations.

### Grade Breakdown

Your final grade is a weighted average of the following:

**Lectures, Readings, and Quizzes on Perusall (30% total).** You'll receive credit for engaging with lectures and case studies on [www.perusall.com](http://www.perusall.com). Grading is based on a combination of (1) time spent actively working on the assignment, (2) number and quality of comments, and (3) score on the final quiz.

**Midterm and Final Exams (50% total).**  These are the exams for the course. You'll have two hours to complete each. You'll need a computer with a **webcam** to take these.

**Presentation (20% total)**. Near the end of the semester, you'll be designing and delvering your own 20-minute "lesson" on a topic related to AI and Computing Ethics. 

### Plagiarism and Academic Integrity ⚖️ 

Your work should be your own---please don't use your classmates, friends, parents, internet sites, etc., to help you write your papers or answer test questions. And when you do use outside sources, make sure to give appropriate citation and acknowledgment for any words, ideas, or arguments. If the preponderance of the evidence suggests cheating has occurred (that is, if the evidence indicates that this is *more likely than not*), you may receive a failing grade for the assignment (at minimum) or class as a whole.

### Policy on Generative AI 🤖

I encourage you to use generative AI (ChatGPT, Gemini, Bing, Claude, etc.) to help you understand class content when needed (and mastering these tools will be important to almost any career path), and to work on your own projects (I've used it in my own projects, including for this course!). However, the use of generative AI is **ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN** when it comes to answering questions on exams.

### Attendance 📅

Students in face-to-face classes should attend class regularly, while online students are expected to participate in class discussions and activities. If you miss more than 1/3 of the total class sessions (and/or class assignments), you may receive a failing grade of FW. This may endanger your ability to receive financial aid. You are responsible for withdrawing from the class if you decide not to continue. I am willing to make exceptions if circumstances require, but you must let me know about these promptly.

## Using Perusall 📝 

Perusall is a digital platform that we're using to enhance your learning. It allows you to collaboratively annotate readings and engage with your classmates and me. The goal is to make reading more interactive and to deepen your understanding of the material.

You'll access Perusall through links provided in our D2L-Brightspace course. Once you click on these links, you'll be directed to the readings assigned for our class.

For each reading, you\'ll need to post annotations. These can be
questions, comments, replies to comments of others, or reflections. Make
sure to read others\' annotations, too, and respond when you can. This
is part of your active participation.

## Policy on Late Work ⏰

**Please read the following *before* emailing me to request an extension on an assignment.** 

If you miss a quiz or activity due to a brief sickness, work conflict, class trip, computer malfunction, wedding, auto problem, court date, funeral, sporting event, etc., you do NOT need to email me (though it's okay if you want to give me a heads up). Here are my policies for making up missed or late work:

Perusall reading assignments can be submitted up to two days late for reduced credit. Credit declines "linearly" (basically, if you submit it one minute late, you get 99.9% of the credit; if you submit it 1.5 days late, you'll get almost no credit).

Exams cannot be taken late without explicit permission from me, and should be for a good reason; late exams (if allowed) will receive reduced credit. 

**I will make exceptions to these policies if you can demonstrate a genuine need.** Please talk to me if anything comes up that is preventing you from succeeding in class.

## Getting in Touch with Me 📧

The best way to get ahold of me is by email, which I will aim to respond to within ONE working day (for simple questions) or TWO working days (for more complex ones). I don't generally check email on the weekends or holidays. If you don't hear from me by then, please try emailing me again. To help me provide you with quick, effective feedback, here's a general template for what I expect in an email.
