# Computing and AI Ethics
**Brendan Shea,PhD**

This is course notes for a class in Computing and AI Ethics, first taught at Rochester Community and Technical College in Spring 2026. This is available under a CC BY-NC 4.0 license (so, feel free to use and adapt it! Just don't sell it). I've used AI tools in helping prepare and edit these lecture notes (primarily in the context of VSCode CoPilot, to help with LaTeX code).

I welcome any feedback--you send me an email at brendanpshea@gmail.com.
