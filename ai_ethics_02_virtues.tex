\begin{frame}{Essential Questions}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item What kind of people do we \textbf{become} through our daily digital habits and social media use?
        \item Can \textbf{virtue ethics}---a 2,400-year-old philosophical tradition---help us navigate the challenges of social media?
        \item How has the rise of \textbf{Web 2.0} fundamentally changed the way we form communities and relationships?
        \item Is social media actually causing a \textbf{mental health crisis} among teenagers, or is the evidence more complicated?
    \end{itemize}

% SLIDE 3: Why Virtue Ethics for Social Media?
% ============================================
\begin{frame}{Why Virtue Ethics for Social Media?}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Rule-based ethics} asks: ``Is this particular action right or wrong?''
        \item \textbf{Virtue ethics} asks: ``What kind of person does this action make me over time?''
        \item Social media is not just about individual posts or clicks---it \textbf{shapes our character} through daily habits.
        \item Philosopher Shannon Vallor argues that technologies can either \textbf{cultivate or undermine} virtues like patience, honesty, and empathy.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \begin{block}{Key Insight}
        Virtue ethics focuses on long-term character formation, making it especially suited for analyzing technologies we use every day.

                \item \textbf{Aristotle (384--322 BCE)} was a Greek philosopher, student of Plato, and tutor to Alexander the Great.
                \item \textbf{Eudaimonia} is often translated as ``happiness,'' but is better understood as ``human flourishing'' or ``living well.'' (\cite{aristotle_nicomachean})
                \item Eudaimonia is not a temporary feeling but a \textbf{way of living}---achieving your full potential as a human being.

% ============================================
\begin{frame}{What Are the Virtues?}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A \textbf{virtue} is a stable character trait that enables us to act well and to flourish as human beings.
        \item Virtues are developed through \textbf{practice and habituation}---we become courageous by repeatedly acting courageously.
        \item Each virtue lies between two corresponding \textbf{vices}: one of excess and one of deficiency.
    \end{itemize}

% SLIDE 6: The Doctrine of the Mean
% ============================================
\begin{frame}{The Doctrine of the Mean}
    \begin{itemize}
        \scriptsize
        \item \textbf{The doctrine of the mean} states that virtue is the balanced midpoint between two extremes (vices of excess and deficiency).
        \item The mean is \textbf{not mathematical}---it varies depending on the person, situation, and context.
        \item Finding the mean requires \textbf{practical wisdom} (phronesis) to judge what is appropriate in each circumstance.
        \end{itemize}

% ============================================
\begin{frame}{Phronesis---Practical Wisdom}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Phronesis} (practical wisdom) is the intellectual virtue of knowing what to do in particular situations.
        \item It is not enough to know \textit{that} honesty is good---phronesis tells us \textit{how} to be honest in a specific context.
        \item Susan Sauvé Meyer: ``You are not a good person unless you exercise \textbf{good judgment}.''
        \item Phronesis is developed through \textbf{experience and reflection}, not just by learning abstract rules.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \begin{exampleblock}{Applying Phronesis to Social Media}
        Practical wisdom helps us judge: When should I post? What should I share? How should I respond to criticism? What content deserves my attention?

        \item \textbf{Self-presentation}: The vice of excess is \textbf{bragging}; the vice of deficiency is \textbf{false modesty} or inauthenticity.

% SLIDE 9: Communitarianism and Civic Virtue
% ============================================
\begin{frame}{Communitarianism and Civic Virtue}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Communitarianism} emphasizes that human identity and virtue are formed within communities---including \textbf{political communities}.
        \item Key thinkers (MacIntyre, Sandel, Taylor) argue that liberal individualism neglects our obligations to the \textbf{common good}.
        \item \textbf{Civic virtues} are character traits necessary for democratic citizenship: tolerance, civic friendship, commitment to truth, willingness to deliberate.
        \item Aristotle: Humans are \textit{zoon politikon}---``political animals'' who flourish through participation in \textbf{shared civic life}.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \begin{block}{Michael Sandel on Civic Virtue}
        Democracy requires more than voting---it requires citizens with the \textbf{character} to engage respectfully with those who disagree, to seek common ground, and to place the common good above narrow self-interest. (\cite{sandel_democracy})

            \textbf{Essential Civic Virtues:}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item \textbf{Civic friendship}: Seeing political opponents as fellow citizens, not enemies
                \item \textbf{Tolerance}: Respecting others' right to hold different views
                \item \textbf{Deliberative capacity}: Ability to reason together about the common good

                \item \textbf{Commitment to truth}: Valuing facts over tribal loyalty
                \item \textbf{Civility}: Engaging respectfully even in disagreement

% ============================================
% SLIDE 11: MacIntyre, Practices, and the Common Good
% ============================================
\begin{frame}{MacIntyre, Practices, and the Common Good}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Alasdair MacIntyre's \textit{After Virtue} (\cite{macintyre_after_virtue}) warned that modern society has lost \textbf{shared frameworks} for moral reasoning.
        \item Without shared traditions and practices, moral discourse becomes mere assertion of preferences---``emotivism.''
        \item \textbf{Key insight}: Virtues are cultivated through participation in \textbf{practices} with shared standards and goods.
        \item Democratic deliberation is itself a \textbf{practice} requiring specific virtues: listening, reasoning, compromising.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \begin{exampleblock}{The Question for Our Age}
        If virtues require shared practices and communities, what happens when our primary ``community'' is a social media feed algorithmically designed to show us only what we already believe?

% SLIDE 13: Part 2 Introduction---Technology and the Virtues
% ============================================
\begin{frame}{Technology and the Virtues}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Recall: For Aristotle, virtues are developed through \textbf{practice within communities} that model and reinforce good character.
        \item Philosopher \textbf{Shannon Vallor} argues that technologies are not neutral tools---they \textbf{shape the conditions} under which virtues can (or cannot) flourish. (\cite{vallor_technology_virtues})
        \item \textbf{Key question}: How has the rise of Web 2.0 changed the communities and practices through which we develop virtue?
        \item Psychologist \textbf{Sherry Turkle} warns that digital communication may undermine capacities for empathy, patience, and authentic self-knowledge.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \begin{alertblock}{Vallor's Central Claim}
        ``New social media invite \textbf{new habits} of communication and social interaction... [that] have the potential to impact our cultivation of the virtues.'' ---Shannon Vallor, \textit{Technology and the Virtues} (2016)
    \end{alertblock}

% ============================================
% SLIDE 14: Before Web 2.0---Communities of Virtue
% ============================================
\begin{frame}{Before Web 2.0---Communities of Virtue}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Web 1.0} (approximately 1991--2004) was the ``read-only'' web---users consumed content created by professionals.
        \item From a virtue ethics perspective, Web 1.0 had \textbf{limited impact} on character formation---it was more like a library than a community.
        \item Traditional \textbf{communities of practice} (families, schools, neighborhoods, churches) remained the primary sites where virtues were cultivated.
        \item Face-to-face interaction was still the default mode of social life, preserving opportunities for \textbf{empathy, patience, and presence}.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \begin{block}{Aristotle's Insight}
        Virtue is formed through repeated practice in community with others who model good character. The question: What happens when our ``communities'' become digital?

% ============================================
% SLIDE 15: Defining Web 2.0---A New Context for Character
% ============================================
\begin{frame}{Defining Web 2.0---A New Context for Character}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{``Web 2.0''} (coined 1999, popularized 2004) marked the shift from passive consumption to active participation online.
        \item Tim O'Reilly's definition: ``The web as a platform''---users now \textbf{create content}, not just consume it.
        \item From a virtue perspective, this is profound: our daily \textbf{habits of communication and self-presentation} now occur in digital spaces.
        \item Vallor asks: Do these new habits cultivate virtues like honesty and empathy---or do they cultivate their opposing vices?
    \end{itemize}
    
    \begin{exampleblock}{The Virtue Ethics Question}
        Web 2.0 isn't just a technological change---it's a change in the \textbf{environment where character is formed}. What kind of people are we becoming through our daily digital practices?

        \item TIME declared: ``It's about the many wresting power from the few and helping one another for nothing.''
        \item From a virtue perspective, this \textbf{optimistic vision} emphasized potential for generosity, collaboration, and democratic participation.

% ============================================
\begin{frame}{The Smartphone and Constant Connectivity}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The \textbf{iPhone} (2007) put social media in our pockets, enabling constant connectivity and instant response.
        \item Sherry Turkle argues this undermines \textbf{solitude}---the capacity to be alone with one's thoughts, essential for self-knowledge. 
        \item Constant notifications interrupt \textbf{sustained attention}---what Vallor calls a key ``technomoral virtue'' for our age.
        \item The virtue of \textbf{patience} is particularly challenged when we expect instant responses and infinite content.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \begin{alertblock}{Turkle on Solitude and Self-Knowledge}
        ``If we don't teach our children to be alone, they will only know how to be \textbf{lonely}.'' Solitude is necessary for the self-reflection that virtue ethics requires.

        \item \textbf{Affective polarization}: We don't just disagree with the other party---we \textit{dislike} and \textit{distrust} them as people.
        \item This represents a failure of \textbf{civic friendship}---the Aristotelian virtue of seeing fellow citizens as partners in a shared project.

% ============================================
\begin{frame}{The Attention Economy and Democratic Attention}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The \textbf{attention economy} captures our attention for profit---but attention is also a \textbf{civic resource}.
        \item Democracy requires citizens who can sustain attention on \textbf{complex issues}---not just react to outrage.
        \item Persuasive design (infinite scroll, notifications, variable rewards) trains us toward \textbf{distraction}, not deliberation.
        \item Platforms optimize for \textbf{engagement}, which favors emotional, divisive content over nuanced civic discourse.
    \end{itemize}

% SLIDE 25: Interpreting Statistics Through Virtue Ethics
% ============================================
\begin{frame}{Interpreting Statistics Through Virtue Ethics}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Statistics on social media use reveal patterns of \textbf{habit formation}---and habits shape character.
        \item Aristotle: ``We are what we repeatedly do.'' Daily digital practices are forming (or deforming) the virtues.
        \item \textbf{Key interpretive question}: What do these patterns tell us about temperance, honesty, friendship, and practical wisdom?
        \item Communitarians add: Statistics also reveal how digital environments affect \textbf{civic virtue} and shared democratic life.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \begin{block}{The Virtue Ethics Approach to Data}
        Instead of asking only ``Is social media harmful?'' we ask: ``What kind of \textbf{people}---and what kind of \textbf{citizens}---are we becoming through these daily digital habits?''

% ============================================
% SLIDE 26: Akrasia---Weakness of Will as a Source of Vice
% ============================================
\begin{frame}{Akrasia---Weakness of Will as a Source of Vice}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Aristotle identified \textbf{akrasia} (weakness of will) as a key obstacle to virtue: knowing what's good but failing to do it.
        \item The akratic person's \textbf{appetites} overpower their \textbf{reason}---they act against their own better judgment.
        \item Pew \parencite*{pew_teens_2024} reports \textbf{45\%} of teens say they spend ``too much time'' on social media; 44\% have tried to cut back.
        \item This is textbook akrasia: They \textit{know} moderation is better, but \textit{cannot} achieve it.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \begin{alertblock}{Why Akrasia Matters}
        Platforms are \textbf{engineered} to exploit weakness of will---variable rewards, infinite scroll, and social validation trigger appetites that overwhelm rational self-control. This isn't mere personal failure; it's a \textbf{designed environment} that systematically produces akrasia.

        \item \textbf{Honesty}: The ``highlight reel'' problem cultivates \textbf{boastfulness}---the vice of exaggerated self-presentation.
        \item \textbf{Humility}: 46\% feel worse about body image; constant comparison distorts accurate self-knowledge.
        \item \textbf{Patience/Self-control}: Nighttime use disrupts sleep, reflecting inability to wait or rest. \cite{woods_scott_sleep}
    \end{itemize}
    
    \begin{block}{The Interconnection of Vices}

        \item Aristotle distinguished \textbf{virtue friendships} (mutual character development) from mere \textbf{utility/pleasure friendships}.
        \item \textbf{Civic friendship}: Polarization data shows collapse of seeing opponents as fellow citizens---``very unfavorable'' views doubled since 1990s.
        \item \textbf{Trust in institutions}: Historic lows \parencite*{gallup_institutions_2024} reflect erosion of the shared frameworks communitarians say virtue requires.

\begin{frame}{Framing the Debate---Character and Resilience}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Jonathan Haidt's \textit{The Anxious Generation} \parencite{haidt_anxious_generation} can be understood as a claim about \textbf{virtue formation}.
        \item His core argument: The ``phone-based childhood'' is producing young people who lack \textbf{resilience}---the ability to cope with adversity.
        \item Haidt draws on the concept of \textbf{antifragility}: like bones and muscles, character \textit{needs} challenges to develop strength.
        \item From a virtue ethics view, this is a claim that social media environments \textbf{systematically prevent} the development of certain virtues.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \begin{block}{The Virtue Ethics Translation}

        \item \textbf{Multiple indicators}: Rising anxiety, depression, self-harm, and loneliness suggest failures in developing \textbf{emotional resilience}.
        \item Haidt frames this as a \textbf{generational character shift}---not individual pathology but systematic environmental change.

        \item Przybylski accuses Haidt of ``vote counting''---emphasizing \textbf{quantity} of studies over \textbf{quality} of evidence.
        \item Only 22 of 476 cited studies have data on \textit{both} heavy social media use \textit{and} serious mental health issues in adolescents.

        \item Social media affects both \textbf{personal virtues} (temperance, patience, honesty) and \textbf{civic virtues} (tolerance, civic friendship, commitment to truth).
        \item Haidt focuses primarily on personal mental health; but the evidence also shows threats to \textbf{democratic health}.
        \item Echo chambers, polarization, and misinformation undermine the \textbf{shared civic life} communitarians say virtue requires.
        \item A complete analysis must address both individual flourishing \textit{and} our capacity for democratic self-governance.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \begin{block}{The Communitarian Synthesis}
        Personal and civic virtue are connected: We develop character \textit{within} communities, including political communities. When social media fragments the public sphere, it damages both individual and collective flourishing.

\begin{frame}{Final Review Questions}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Distinguish personal virtues from civic virtues.} How does social media potentially threaten each type?
        
        \vspace{0.1cm}
        \item \textbf{What is ``civic friendship''?} Why do communitarians believe it is essential for democracy, and how might social media undermine it?
        
        \vspace{0.1cm}
        \item \textbf{Explain the connection} between echo chambers, polarization, and the decline of deliberative capacity.
        
        \vspace{0.1cm}
        \item \textbf{Evaluate this claim}: ``The threat social media poses to democracy is more serious than its threat to individual mental health.'' Do you agree? Why or why not?
        
        \vspace{0.1cm}
        \item \textbf{Final Discussion}: Design a ``virtue-centered'' social media policy for a democratic society. What would it aim to cultivate? What practices and institutions would support it?
