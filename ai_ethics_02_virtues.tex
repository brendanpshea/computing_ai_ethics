% ============================================
\begin{frame}{Essential Questions}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item What kind of people do we \textbf{become} through our daily digital habits and social media use?
        \item Can \textbf{virtue ethics}---a 2,400-year-old philosophical tradition---help us navigate the challenges of social media?
        \item How has the rise of \textbf{Web 2.0} fundamentally changed the way we form communities and relationships?
        \item Is social media actually causing a \textbf{mental health crisis} among teenagers, or is the evidence more complicated?
    \end{itemize}

% SLIDE 3: Why Virtue Ethics for Social Media?
% ============================================
\begin{frame}{Why Virtue Ethics for Social Media?}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Rule-based ethics} asks: ``Is this particular action right or wrong?''
        \item \textbf{Virtue ethics} asks: ``What kind of person does this action make me over time?''
        \item Social media is not just about individual posts or clicks---it \textbf{shapes our character} through daily habits.
        \item Philosopher Shannon Vallor argues that technologies can either \textbf{cultivate or undermine} virtues like patience, honesty, and empathy.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \begin{block}{Key Insight}
        Virtue ethics focuses on long-term character formation, making it especially suited for analyzing technologies we use every day.

                \item \textbf{Aristotle (384--322 BCE)} was a Greek philosopher, student of Plato, and tutor to Alexander the Great.
                \item \textbf{Eudaimonia} is often translated as ``happiness,'' but is better understood as ``human flourishing'' or ``living well.'' (\cite{aristotle_nicomachean})
                \item Eudaimonia is not a temporary feeling but a \textbf{way of living}---achieving your full potential as a human being.

% ============================================
\begin{frame}{What Are the Virtues?}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A \textbf{virtue} is a stable character trait that enables us to act well and to flourish as human beings.
        \item Virtues are developed through \textbf{practice and habituation}---we become courageous by repeatedly acting courageously.
        \item Each virtue lies between two corresponding \textbf{vices}: one of excess and one of deficiency.
    \end{itemize}

% SLIDE 6: The Doctrine of the Mean
% ============================================
\begin{frame}{The Doctrine of the Mean}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{The doctrine of the mean} states that virtue is the balanced midpoint between two extremes (vices of excess and deficiency).
        \item The mean is \textbf{not mathematical}---it varies depending on the person, situation, and context.
        \item Finding the mean requires \textbf{practical wisdom} (phronesis) to judge what is appropriate in each circumstance.
    \end{itemize}

% ============================================
\begin{frame}{Phronesis---Practical Wisdom}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Phronesis} (practical wisdom) is the intellectual virtue of knowing what to do in particular situations.
        \item It is not enough to know \textit{that} honesty is good---phronesis tells us \textit{how} to be honest in a specific context.
        \item Susan Sauvé Meyer: ``You are not a good person unless you exercise \textbf{good judgment}.''
        \item Phronesis is developed through \textbf{experience and reflection}, not just by learning abstract rules.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \begin{exampleblock}{Applying Phronesis to Social Media}
        Practical wisdom helps us judge: When should I post? What should I share? How should I respond to criticism? What content deserves my attention?

        \item \textbf{Appropriate humor}: Aristotle recognized that jokes often come at someone's expense---what will you laugh at or share?
        \item \textbf{Self-presentation}: The vice of excess is \textbf{bragging}; the vice of deficiency is \textbf{false modesty} or inauthenticity.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \begin{block}{Key Insight from Susan Sauvé Meyer (\cite{meyer_aristotelian_virtues})}

% SLIDE 9: Communitarianism and Civic Virtue
% ============================================
\begin{frame}{Communitarianism and Civic Virtue}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Communitarianism} emphasizes that human identity and virtue are formed within communities---including \textbf{political communities}.
        \item Key thinkers (MacIntyre, Sandel, Taylor) argue that liberal individualism neglects our obligations to the \textbf{common good}.
        \item \textbf{Civic virtues} are character traits necessary for democratic citizenship: tolerance, civic friendship, commitment to truth, willingness to deliberate.
        \item Aristotle: Humans are \textit{zoon politikon}---``political animals'' who flourish through participation in \textbf{shared civic life}.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \begin{block}{Michael Sandel on Civic Virtue}
        Democracy requires more than voting---it requires citizens with the \textbf{character} to engage respectfully with those who disagree, to seek common ground, and to place the common good above narrow self-interest. (\cite{sandel_democracy})

            \textbf{Essential Civic Virtues:}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item \textbf{Civic friendship}: Seeing political opponents as fellow citizens, not enemies
                \item \textbf{Tolerance}: Respecting others' right to hold different views
                \item \textbf{Deliberative capacity}: Ability to reason together about the common good

            \textbf{Supporting Virtues:}

                \item \textbf{Epistemic humility}: Acknowledging we might be wrong
                \item \textbf{Commitment to truth}: Valuing facts over tribal loyalty
                \item \textbf{Civility}: Engaging respectfully even in disagreement

% ============================================
% SLIDE 11: MacIntyre, Practices, and the Common Good
% ============================================
\begin{frame}{MacIntyre, Practices, and the Common Good}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Alasdair MacIntyre's \textit{After Virtue} (\cite{macintyre_after_virtue}) warned that modern society has lost \textbf{shared frameworks} for moral reasoning.
        \item Without shared traditions and practices, moral discourse becomes mere assertion of preferences---``emotivism.''
        \item \textbf{Key insight}: Virtues are cultivated through participation in \textbf{practices} with shared standards and goods.
        \item Democratic deliberation is itself a \textbf{practice} requiring specific virtues: listening, reasoning, compromising.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \begin{exampleblock}{The Question for Our Age}
        If virtues require shared practices and communities, what happens when our primary ``community'' is a social media feed algorithmically designed to show us only what we already believe?

        \vspace{0.15cm}
        \item \textbf{What are ``civic virtues''?} Why do communitarians believe they are essential for democracy?
        
        \vspace{0.15cm}
        \item \textbf{According to MacIntyre,} what has modern society ``lost'' that makes moral reasoning difficult? How might this apply to online discourse?
        
        \vspace{0.15cm}
        \item \textbf{Discussion}: Can a person develop civic virtues like tolerance and deliberative capacity primarily through online political engagement? Why or why not?
    \end{enumerate}

% ============================================
% SLIDE 13: Part 2 Introduction---Technology and the Virtues
% ============================================
\begin{frame}{Technology and the Virtues}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Recall: For Aristotle, virtues are developed through \textbf{practice within communities} that model and reinforce good character.
        \item Philosopher \textbf{Shannon Vallor} argues that technologies are not neutral tools---they \textbf{shape the conditions} under which virtues can (or cannot) flourish. (\cite{vallor_technology_virtues})
        \item \textbf{Key question for Part 2}: How has the rise of Web 2.0 changed the communities and practices through which we develop virtue?
        \item Psychologist \textbf{Sherry Turkle} warns that digital communication may undermine capacities for empathy, patience, and authentic self-knowledge.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \begin{alertblock}{Vallor's Central Claim}
        ``New social media invite \textbf{new habits} of communication and social interaction... [that] have the potential to impact our cultivation of the virtues.'' ---Shannon Vallor, \textit{Technology and the Virtues} (2016)
    \end{alertblock}

% ============================================
% SLIDE 14: Before Web 2.0---Communities of Virtue
% ============================================
\begin{frame}{Before Web 2.0---Communities of Virtue}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Web 1.0} (approximately 1991--2004) was the ``read-only'' web---users consumed content created by professionals.
        \item From a virtue ethics perspective, Web 1.0 had \textbf{limited impact} on character formation---it was more like a library than a community.
        \item Traditional \textbf{communities of practice} (families, schools, neighborhoods, churches) remained the primary sites where virtues were cultivated.
        \item Face-to-face interaction was still the default mode of social life, preserving opportunities for \textbf{empathy, patience, and presence}.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \begin{block}{Aristotle's Insight}
        Virtue is formed through repeated practice in community with others who model good character. The question: What happens when our ``communities'' become digital?

% ============================================
% SLIDE 15: Defining Web 2.0---A New Context for Character
% ============================================
\begin{frame}{Defining Web 2.0---A New Context for Character}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{``Web 2.0''} (coined 1999, popularized 2004) marked the shift from passive consumption to active participation online.
        \item Tim O'Reilly's definition: ``The web as a platform''---users now \textbf{create content}, not just consume it.
        \item From a virtue perspective, this is profound: our daily \textbf{habits of communication and self-presentation} now occur in digital spaces.
        \item Vallor asks: Do these new habits cultivate virtues like honesty and empathy---or do they cultivate their opposing vices?
    \end{itemize}
    
    \begin{exampleblock}{The Virtue Ethics Question}
        Web 2.0 isn't just a technological change---it's a change in the \textbf{environment where character is formed}. What kind of people are we becoming through our daily digital practices?

    \begin{itemize}
        \item In 2006, \textbf{TIME Magazine} named ``You'' as Person of the Year, celebrating user-generated content and collaboration. (\cite{time_you_2006})
        \item TIME declared: ``It's about the many wresting power from the few and helping one another for nothing.''
        \item From a virtue perspective, this \textbf{optimistic vision} emphasized potential for generosity, collaboration, and democratic participation.
        \item But even then, some worried: Would online interaction cultivate \textbf{genuine virtue}---or merely its appearance?

    \begin{itemize}
        \item The \textbf{iPhone} (2007) put social media in our pockets, enabling constant connectivity and instant response.
        \item Sherry Turkle argues this undermines \textbf{solitude}---the capacity to be alone with one's thoughts, essential for self-knowledge. 
        \item Constant notifications interrupt \textbf{sustained attention}---what Vallor calls a key ``technomoral virtue'' for our age.

    \begin{alertblock}{Turkle on Solitude and Self-Knowledge}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Echo chambers} are social media environments where users encounter only views similar to their own.
        \item Algorithms maximize engagement by showing content that \textbf{confirms existing beliefs}---and outrage at the ``other side.''
        \item This directly undermines \textbf{civic virtues}: Why practice tolerance if you never encounter reasonable disagreement?
        \item Legal scholar Cass Sunstein warned in \textit{Republic.com} (2001) that personalized media would fragment the \textbf{shared public sphere} democracy requires.

        \item \textbf{Affective polarization}: We don't just disagree with the other party---we \textit{dislike} and \textit{distrust} them as people.
        \item This represents a failure of \textbf{civic friendship}---the Aristotelian virtue of seeing fellow citizens as partners in a shared project.
        \item Social media rewards \textbf{performative outrage} over thoughtful deliberation---cultivating vice, not virtue.

\begin{frame}{The Attention Economy and Democratic Attention}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The \textbf{attention economy} captures our attention for profit---but attention is also a \textbf{civic resource}.
        \item Democracy requires citizens who can sustain attention on \textbf{complex issues}---not just react to outrage.
        \item Persuasive design (infinite scroll, notifications, variable rewards) trains us toward \textbf{distraction}, not deliberation.
        \item Platforms optimize for \textbf{engagement}, which favors emotional, divisive content over nuanced civic discourse.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \begin{block}{The Civic Cost of Distraction}

        \item \textbf{Civic empathy}: The capacity to understand fellow citizens' perspectives, even when we disagree.
        \item Digital communication lets us \textbf{curate and control}---we avoid the difficult work of truly listening to different views.

        \item Statistics on social media use aren't just about \textbf{time}---they reveal patterns of \textbf{habit formation}.
        \item Recall Aristotle: Virtues (and vices) are formed through repeated practice over time.
        \item \textbf{Key question}: What do these usage patterns suggest about the character traits being cultivated in young people?
        \item We'll examine the data through the lens of specific virtues: \textbf{temperance}, \textbf{patience}, \textbf{honesty}, \textbf{empathy}, and \textbf{practical wisdom}.
    \end{itemize}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{95\%} of American teens have smartphone access; \textbf{46\%} report being online ``almost constantly.''
        \item Average daily social media use: \textbf{4.8 hours}---nearly one-third of waking hours.
        \item \textbf{45\%} of teens say they spend ``too much time'' on social media---suggesting awareness that temperance is lacking.
        \item 44\% have tried to cut back, indicating a \textbf{struggle for self-control} against habit and design.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \begin{alertblock}{The Temperance Problem}
        When nearly half of users \textit{themselves} believe they use too much, we see evidence that the virtue of \textbf{temperance} (moderation) is being systematically undermined by platform design.

        \item ``Problematic use'' means struggling to \textbf{control} use despite negative consequences---a failure of temperance and self-control.
        \item Girls report higher rates (13\%) than boys (9\%), suggesting gendered patterns in how platforms affect character.
        \item 36\% report \textbf{constant contact} with friends online---blurring boundaries between self and social network.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \begin{exampleblock}{Virtue Ethics Interpretation}
        ``Problematic use'' is essentially what Aristotle would call a \textbf{vice of excess}---the failure to find the moderate mean in digital engagement. The rise from 7\% to 11\% suggests this vice is spreading.

    \begin{itemize}

        \item \textbf{Active use} (creating, meaningfully connecting) may cultivate virtues like creativity and genuine friendship.
        \item \textbf{Passive use} (scrolling, comparing) tends to cultivate vices like envy, impatience, and distorted self-image.
        \item Marginalized communities (LGBTQ+ youth, those with disabilities) may find \textbf{supportive communities} otherwise unavailable.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \begin{exampleblock}{Vallor's Key Distinction}
        Social media can \textbf{supplement} face-to-face relationships (potentially supporting virtue) or \textbf{substitute} for them (likely undermining virtue). The research suggests benefits come primarily from supplementation.

        \item Research struggles to identify a clear ``threshold''---suggesting the answer requires \textbf{individual judgment}, not universal rules.
        \item Orben \& Przybylski found small average effect sizes---but averages obscure the \textbf{individual differences} that phronesis must navigate. (\cite{orben_przybylski})

        \item His core argument: The ``phone-based childhood'' is producing young people who lack \textbf{resilience}---the ability to cope with adversity.
        \item Haidt draws on the concept of \textbf{antifragility}: like bones and muscles, character \textit{needs} challenges to develop strength.
        \item From a virtue ethics view, this is a claim that social media environments \textbf{systematically prevent} the development of certain virtues.

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{No smartphones before high school}---Protect the period when foundational character habits are formed.
        \item \textbf{No social media before 16}---Delay exposure to environments that cultivate vices of comparison and validation-seeking.
        \item \textbf{Phone-free schools}---Restore opportunities for face-to-face interaction that cultivates empathy and social skills.
        \item \textbf{More unsupervised play}---Provide the challenges necessary to develop courage, resilience, and practical wisdom.
    \end{enumerate}
    
    \begin{exampleblock}{The Collective Action Argument}
        Individual families practicing these virtues face social costs. Haidt argues we need \textbf{community-wide norms}---precisely what communitarians like MacIntyre say virtue requires.

\begin{frame}{The Critics---Questioning the Causal Story}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Candace Odgers} (\cite{odgers_anxious_review}) argues Haidt confuses correlation with causation.
        \item She points to alternative explanations: economic insecurity, school violence, climate anxiety, academic pressure.
        \item From a virtue perspective, these are \textit{also} challenges to character formation---but different ones than Haidt emphasizes.
        \item Critics argue the international patterns don't match smartphone adoption timing as closely as claimed.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \begin{block}{The Virtue of Intellectual Humility}
        Both sides of this debate should practice \textbf{intellectual humility}---acknowledging uncertainty, considering alternative views, and proportioning claims to evidence. This is itself a technomoral virtue.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Critics like \textbf{Aaron Brown} \parencite*{brown_critique} and \textbf{Andrew Przybylski} argue that most studies Haidt cites have significant methodological weaknesses.
        \item Przybylski accuses Haidt of ``vote counting''---emphasizing \textbf{quantity} of studies over \textbf{quality} of evidence.
        \item Only 22 of 476 cited studies have data on \textit{both} heavy social media use \textit{and} serious mental health issues in adolescents.
        \item This raises questions about \textbf{epistemic virtues}: Are we believing what the evidence actually supports?
    \end{itemize}
    
    \begin{alertblock}{Vallor on Epistemic Virtue in a Digital Age}
        Vallor emphasizes that \textbf{good judgment about information} is a crucial technomoral virtue. The Haidt debate itself is a case study in how difficult this is when evidence is complex and stakes are high.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Critics suggest Haidt underweights alternative factors: economic precarity, academic pressure, COVID effects, climate anxiety.
        \item \textbf{Melinda Wenner Moyer}: ``I think Haidt is over-stating the research... in ways that undermine faith and trust in science.''
        \item \textbf{Tobias Dienlin}: The crisis may be ``largely limited to the U.S.''---suggesting cultural factors beyond technology.
        \item The virtue of \textbf{intellectual honesty} requires acknowledging what we don't know and presenting uncertainty accurately.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \begin{exampleblock}{Multiple Factors, One Framework}
        Even if social media is only \textit{one} factor among several, virtue ethics still provides a useful lens: All these challenges affect the \textbf{conditions under which character develops}. The question is which factors matter most.

% SLIDE 45: The Full Picture---Personal and Civic Virtue
% ============================================
\begin{frame}{The Full Picture---Personal and Civic Virtue}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Social media affects both \textbf{personal virtues} (temperance, patience, honesty) and \textbf{civic virtues} (tolerance, civic friendship, commitment to truth).
        \item Haidt focuses primarily on personal mental health; but the evidence also shows threats to \textbf{democratic health}.
        \item Echo chambers, polarization, and misinformation undermine the \textbf{shared civic life} communitarians say virtue requires.
        \item A complete analysis must address both individual flourishing \textit{and} our capacity for democratic self-governance.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \begin{block}{The Communitarian Synthesis}
        Personal and civic virtue are connected: We develop character \textit{within} communities, including political communities. When social media fragments the public sphere, it damages both individual and collective flourishing.
